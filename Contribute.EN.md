# How to contribute new clips to Rushia Button?
[中文](https://github.com/Rushia-cn/Rushia-button/blob/master/Contribute.md)

Send us the link to a video (youtube link is recommended for convinience of downloading stand-alone audio files) and time (start and end) for that clip. We will handle the rest. Please provide the name. I18n is recommended -- we currently support ZH and EN, planning to add support for JP in future. 
You can use:
#### Telegram

If you want to do so, please use this format:

Don't forget the quotes around `"name"`! You can use `en, zh, jp` as lang.
